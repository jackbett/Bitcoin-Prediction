# Bitcoin-Preduction
Use Jupyter Notebook and Python to predict monthly Bitcoin prices using linear regression
Using yearly bitcoin data stored in a csv, I extracted monthly data for October, November, and December 2018 and plotted it on a graph.  I then used 3 types of linear regression (RBF, Linear, and Polynomial) to use the monthly data and see how linear progression predicts the final day price in the month.  This was coded using Python in Jupyter notebook.
